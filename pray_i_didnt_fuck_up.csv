PAST
[I am a masters student focussed on high-impact problems in healthcare and NLP using Deep Learning techniques, simultaneously advancing them. I love to work on hard problems in Language and Time Series be it unstructured or structured data. I have worked on many Problems in the past in these fields

I am a very motivated person, passionate to learn and try to become better every day. I strive to produce results and persevere through all the way through. I have a strong interest in Machine Learning/Deep Learning, Data Science, Software Engineering and Quantum Computation.

Currently, I'm a second-year Computer Science graduate student at the Texas A&M University. As a part of my research, I am currently working on developing novel Natural Language Understanding techniques using supervised and unsupervised techniques. Previous to that, I was working on Time Series Data in Heart Patients for the task of Summarization and Interpretability of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Risk Predictive models.

The ability to embed intelligence into systems and artificially imitate human behavior, some of which even we are incapable of, is what excites me a lot about AI. I believe Deep learning will revolutionize intelligent machines.

I'm seeking a position to gain practical skills by working on real-world machine learning and software development projects. I wish to work in a challenging and dynamic environment where I can apply my technical knowledge, skills, and experience to contribute towards and achieve organizational and personal excellence.]

Google is not your conventional company, and we don’t intend to become one. True, we share attributes with the world’s most successful organizations – a focus on innovation and smart business practices comes to mind – but even as we continue to grow, we’re committed to retaining a small-company feel. At Google, we know that every employee has something important to say, and that every employee is integral to our success. We provide individually-tailored compensation packages that can be comprised of competitive salary, bonus, and equity components, along with the opportunity to earn further financial bonuses and rewards. Googlers thrive in small, focused teams and high-energy environments, believe in the ability of technology to change the world, and are as passionate about their lives as they are about their work.

To do that I build and lead highly skilled teams while identifying critical strategic direction changes and related transformation initiatives to be implemented by my team. 

I am very excited to join the Google Cloud team as we look to secure the Cloud and secure our customers. The combination of Mandiant and Google Cloud will make the world (and our customers) a more secure place from the threats posed by cyber threat actors.

Recent CAREER HIGHLIGHTS include:

• Leading the corporate transformation of FEYE including a $100m reduction in SG&A expenses and a shift to cloud products/services culminating in a return to ARR growth and the ultimate $1.2B divestiture of FireEye Products business to Symphony Technology Group in Q2 2021 (closed Oct. 2021).
• Securing a $400m strategic investment in November 2020 in support of our transformation plan.
• Reorganizing and leading strategy and investment initiatives to create Mandiant’s SaaS platform - Mandiant Advantage - including the creation of a unified R&D and Product Mgmt for Mandiant and executing and integrating key acquisitions of Respond Software (Autonomous SOC) and Intrigue (Attack Surface Management).
• Re-platforming the Mandiant back-office systems and processes to leading practice (ongoing).
• Developing Mandiant’s long-term strategic and operating plan to achieve ""Rule of 40"" financial performance.
• Co-leading the sale process of Mandiant to Google Cloud through regulatory approval and deal closure; as well as co-leading integration planning and ongoing integration work to bring these great companies together.

My team’s record of success is built on:

• Combining in-depth organizational and operational knowledge with insights into how to best serve our customers during a company transformation.
• Leveraging our staff’s expertise in cyber and product development to develop a SaaS platform strategy that is unique in the market in its ability to transform cyber operations.
• Ability to execute at speed to move a global organization forward, while bringing along all key stakeholders and staff.
• Ability to partner with Google leadership develop and execute a successful integration plan (ongoing).

PERSONAL

When I’m not working, you can find me spending time with my amazing family - my wife Victoria and our 3 boys - usually involving a bike, a ball or skis (and our 2 dogs).

------------------
I am currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. Since joining USC, I have greatly enhanced my programming skills by taking up the course on Algorithms and also by building some amazing bots as a part of the course on Artificial Intelligence. I have also worked on diversifying my knowledge and skill set by taking up the course on Natural Language Processing and loved every bit of developing projects like a Part of Speech tagger and a Perceptron Classifier.
Currently, I am doing a summer internship at PhaseSpec Corp, AMI-USC. As an intern, I have been developing the iOS version of the application that does analysis on spectral data and then presents it to the user using Plotly density graphs and image segmentation.
Additionally, I have almost 6 years of professional application development experience. During this time, I have programmed in many languages like Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, C# and Swift and worked on a vast array of projects and teams. Most recently, I led a team of developers at Kiota Labs to implement an end to end food delivery platform. My stint at Infosys helped me gain valuable experience in system design and full stack development. At Bitcot Inc. I was solely responsible for designing, developing and shipping the Do Not Disturb iOS application.

Short-term goal: I am looking for full time opportunities which allow me to apply my experience and provide an environment for me to learn; I have a diverse profile and am open to pick up new technologies.

Long-term goal: Make technology more accessible, especially to women. I believe technology can be a game changer if it is accessible to all.

All-time goal: Keep learning, always!

PS: When I am not coding or honing my technical skills, I love writing technical articles @Leetcode.com or @freeCodeCamp.
